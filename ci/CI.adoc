== Running CI tasks locally

IMPORTANT: To do this you must have Docker installed on your machine.

1. `cd ..`
+
Because this tool is actually a subfolder, you must run the Docker container from up above.
+
2. `docker run -it --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/release-tools springci/spring-data-release-tools:0.1 /bin/bash`
+
This will launch the Docker image and mount your source code at `release-tools-github`.
+
3. `cd release-tools`
+
Next, run the `ci/prepare-and-build.bash` script from inside the container:
+
4. `SONATYPE_USR=foo SONATYPE_PSW=bar ci/prepare-and-build.bash <version>`

Since the container is binding to your source, you can make edits from your IDE and continue to run build jobs.

NOTE: Docker containers can eat up disk space fast! From time to time, run `docker system prune` to clean out old images.
